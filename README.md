## üëã Getting started

Welcome to trophoria! This right here is our main repository which contains the backend and frontend implementations. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

If you want to contribute to our community projects, we advice you to fist read through our [wiki pages](https://github.com/trophoria/.github/wiki). If you for example want to learn, how we set up our development environment, you can read our [Development setup](https://github.com/trophoria/.github/wiki/2-Development-setup). You can also read more about the technologies we use and how we structure our projects. For this please visit the [Repository Technologies](https://github.com/trophoria/.github/wiki/1-Repository-Technologies) wiki page. This repository itself contains more useful information like pull request templates, security guidelines and so on. Make sure to read those too!

If you want to develop the flutter application, always use the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/17SShpPAQ5l3G0zFcV7sjm/Trophoria-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1) as a reference. The feature should already be designed. If you want to implement your own feature, which contains UI Implementations, please request access to the Figma file via [email](mailto:trophoria@gmail.com), so you can design it first. If you are not good at designing, don't hesitate to ask for help in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/qWPyFWkff6). Also keep in mind, that you should always use the provided flutter theme. If the theme does not fit your needs, extend it and use your own implementation.

If you want to look at our tracked tasks, you can visit our public [YouTrack Board](https://trophoria.youtrack.cloud/agiles/131-2/current). Most of the issues are getting translated into tasks, so we try to keep everything updated there.

And now, happy coding! üéâ
